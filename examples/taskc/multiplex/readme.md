Here we see an example of a scenario where we have multiple threads but they are bound to be no more that a limited number of threads. This is a common scenario  In this case, we can use the `multiplex` combinator to limit the number of threads that are running concurrently. This implemenmtation uses a counting semaphore starting at the capacity that we can have at any given time. So each thread can start freely without problem until there is no more room. in which case they will have to wait for another thread to finish
