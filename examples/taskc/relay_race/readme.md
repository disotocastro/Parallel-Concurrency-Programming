in this example we simulate a relay race, where the competitors are teams of threads. Each team consists of two runners. A runner will take the baton and stand at the starting line. The other runner will wait in the middle of the track for the first runner to arrive and transfer the baton to him. At that time, the second runner will continue at full speed until reaching the finish line. Only the first three teams to reach the finish line win, who are awarded gold, silver, and bronze.

Your simulation will receive three parameters: the number of teams, the duration in milliseconds it takes for the first rider to go through stage 1 of the race (between the start and the middle of the track), and the duration in milliseconds for the second rider to go through the stage. 2 of the race (from the middle of the track to the finish line). Assume that the runners in a stage take exactly this duration and not a randomly generated value.
